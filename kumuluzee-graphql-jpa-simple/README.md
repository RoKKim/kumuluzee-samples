# KumuluzEE GraphQL sample with JPA and CDI with GraphQL

> Convert an existing REST application to GraphQL and pack it as a KumuluzEE microservice.

The objective of this sample is to demonstrate how to convert your existing JPA/CDI application to expose GraphQL
API instead of REST. Before starting this tutorial, please make sure, that you have finished
[KumuluzEE JPA and CDI with REST](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/tree/master/jpa) tutorial.

## Requirements

In order to run this example you will need the following:

1. Java 21 (or newer), you can use any implementation:
    * If you have installed Java, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:

        ```
        java -version
        ```

2. Maven 3.2.1 (or newer):
    * If you have installed Maven, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:

        ```
        mvn -version
        ```
3. Git:
    * If you have installed Git, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:

        ```
        git --version
        ```

## Prerequisites

In order to run this sample you will have to setup a local PostgreSQL database:

- __database host__: localhost:5432
- __database name__: customers
- __user__: postgres
- __password__: postgres

The required tables will be created automatically upon running the sample.
You can run databases with docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name pg-graphql -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=customers -p 5432:5432 postgres:latest
```

## Usage

The example uses maven to build and run the microservices.

1. Build the sample using maven:

    ```bash
    $ cd kumuluzee-graphql-jpa-simple
    $ mvn clean package
    ```

2. Run the sample:

* Uber-jar:

    ```bash
    $ java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
    ```

  in Windows environemnt use the command
    ```batch
    java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
    ```

* Exploded:

    ```bash
    $ java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication
    ```

  in Windows environment use the command
    ```batch
    java -cp target/classes;target/dependency/* com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication
    ```

The application/service can be accessed on the following URL:

* GraphQL endpoint - http://localhost:8080/graphql
* GraphiQL endpoint - http://localhost:8080/graphiql (playground for executing queries)

To shut down the example simply stop the processes in the foreground.

## Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the steps required to create a simple GraphQL microservice which uses JPA 2.1 and
pack it as a KumuluzEE microservice. We will extend the existing
[KumuluzEE JPA and CDI sample](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/tree/master/jpa).
Therefore, first complete the existing sample tutorial, or clone the JPA and CDI sample code. We will use PostgreSQL
in this tutorial.

We will follow these steps:

* Add Maven dependencies
* Remove JAX-RS annotations and replace them with GraphQL annotations
* Build the microservice
* Run it

### Add Maven dependencies

Since your existing starting point is the existing KumuluzEE JPA and CDI sample, you should already have the
dependencies for `kumuluzee-bom`, `kumuluzee-core`, `kumuluzee-servlet-jetty`, `kumuluzee-jax-rs-jersey`,
`kumuluzee-cdi-weld`, `kumuluzee-jpa-eclipselink` and `postgresql` configured in `pom.xml`.

Add the `kumuluzee-graphql-mp` and `kumuluzz-graphql-ui` dependencies and remove `kumuluzee-jax-rs-jersey` dependency.
GraphQL extension also requires `kumuluzee-json-p-jsonp`, `kumuluzee-json-b-yasson` and `kumuluzee-config-mp`
dependencies, so also add those:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee.graphql</groupId>
    <artifactId>kumuluzee-graphql-mp</artifactId>
    <version>${kumuluzee-graphql.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee.graphql</groupId>
    <artifactId>kumuluzee-graphql-ui</artifactId>
    <version>${kumuluzee-graphql.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee</groupId>
    <artifactId>kumuluzee-json-p-jsonp</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee</groupId>
    <artifactId>kumuluzee-json-b-yasson</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee.config</groupId>
    <artifactId>kumuluzee-config-mp</artifactId>
    <version>${kumuluzee-config-mp.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

`kumuluzee-maven-plugin` should already be added to your project from JPA and CDI sample.

### Converting REST service to GraphQL endpoint

Here are the required steps:

- Delete CustomerApplication.java file, because we will no longer be using the REST endpoint
- Replace REST annotations (`@Consumes @Produces and @Path`) with `@GraphQLApi` annotation
- Register API endpoints to become GraphQL queries and mutations: replace `@GET` annotations with `@Query`
  and `@POST`, `@DELETE` annotations with `@Mutation`
- Remove all `@Path` annotations
- Replace parameters annotations (`@PathParam("name")` with `@Name("name")`)
- Replace output types (we are not returning `Response` anymore but actual types; e.g. `getAllCustomers` should
  return `List<Customer>` and not `Response`)

The final code should look something like this:

```java
@RequestScoped
@GraphQLApi
public class CustomerResource {

    @Inject
    private CustomerService customerBean;

    @Query
    public List<Customer> getAllCustomers() {
        return customerBean.getCustomers();
    }

    @Query
    public Customer getCustomer(@Name("customerId") String customerId) {
        return customerBean.getCustomer(customerId);
    }

    @Mutation
    public Customer addNewCustomer(@Name("customer") Customer customer) {
        customerBean.saveCustomer(customer);
        return customer;
    }

    @Mutation
    public void deleteCustomer(@Name("customerId") String customerId) {
        customerBean.deleteCustomer(customerId);
    }
}

```

### Build the microservice and run it

To build the microservice and run the example, use the commands as described in previous sections. Graph*i*QL
(GraphQL UI) should now be accessible on http://localhost:8080/graphiql.

### Executing queries

You can see the generated schema at: http://localhost:8080/graphql/schema.graphql

You can now try executing queries. You can start with one of these:

```graphql
mutation addCustomer {
  addNewCustomer(customer: {id: "1", firstName: "Gary", lastName: "Bartlett"}) {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}

query getAllCustomers {
  allCustomers {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}

query getCustomerById {
  customer(customerId: "1") {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}

mutation deleteCustomer {
  deleteCustomer(customerId: "1")
}
```
